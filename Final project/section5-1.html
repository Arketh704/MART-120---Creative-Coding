            As you turn away from the glowing tanks, the unsettling encounter with the person inside still fresh in your mind, you walk back toward the door you entered through. The eerie glow of the room begins to fade behind you as you approach the exit, but your sense of unease lingers.

Just as you reach the doorway, you are stopped by the sudden appearance of two large figures blocking your path. They are imposing, towering over you and exuding an aura of menace. The figures are a grotesque fusion of flesh and metal, their bodies a patchwork of sinewy muscle and polished, cold steel.

Their faces are obscured by heavy helmets or masks, and their eyes glow with an unnatural light, like that of the tanks you just left behind. The combination of organic and mechanical elements creates an eerie, unsettling presence.

You realize these figures are likely the security of the room, their forms designed for both intimidation and enforcement. Their powerful limbs and metallic enhancements suggest they are not to be trifled with.

One of the figures steps forward, its movement surprisingly smooth for its massive size. Its glowing eyes lock onto yours, and you can feel the weight of its gaze. It raises a hand, signaling for you to stop and remain where you are.

The other figure stands behind, silent but no less imposing, effectively cutting off any chance of retreat. The two figures are now between you and the doorway, leaving you with little choice but to comply.
